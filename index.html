              <p> I have listened to this singer since I was 15 years old, once in California a friend put it on while we were resting from surfing and I really liked it. </p>

            Jack Hody Johnson (born May 18, 1975) is an American
            singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, actor, record producer,
            documentary filmmaker and former professional surfer. Johnson is
            known primarily for his work in the soft rock and acoustic pop
            genres. In 2001, he achieved commercial success after the release of
            his debut album, Brushfire Fairytales. Johnson has reached number
            one on the Billboard 200 chart with his albums Sing-A-Longs and
            Lullabies for the Film Curious George in 2006, Sleep Through the
            Static in 2008, To the Sea in 2010 and From Here to Now to You in
            2013. His album In Between Dreams peaked at number two on the chart
            in 2005 and again in 2013. Johnson is active in environmentalism and
            sustainability, often with a focus on the world's oceans. Johnson
            and his wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and
            the K≈çkua Hawaii Foundation. In 2008, Johnson adopted the concept of
            greening (reduce and reuse), and donated 100% of the proceeds of the
            Sleep Through the Static tour to the Johnson Ohana Charitable
            Foundation. Similarly, the proceeds from the 2010 To the Sea album
            tour went to All at Once, a Johnson-backed collaboration of greening
            charities promoting fan involvement.

          This is Jack. Jack likes music. Jack does not like plastics. The good
          news for most of us is that Jack is good at the things he likes and
          that has allowed him to approach ways to eliminate the things he does
          not like.
